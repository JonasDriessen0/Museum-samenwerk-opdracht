        <h4>History</h4>

        <p> 
            A garage box in The Hague was the place where the adventure started in 2008 for Hasan Tasdemir and Pascal Rappailles.
            Together with two friends, they started a collection of arcade video games.
            The garage soon turned out to be too small, after which they moved to a warehouse on an industrial estate.
            Unfortunately, the shed was not heated and in the middle of winter they had to transfer everything to an empty Ministry of Agriculture.
            Because there was no room to renovate or play with the cabinets, they decided to look for a suitable space.
            In 2011 they found a suitable location on the Cobaltstraat in Zoetermeer.
            Together with 4 friends they rented the location and the adventure could grow into their own meeting place to practice their hobby and relax with a game.
            Soon there were more people who wanted to participate, so that both the location and the hobby approach were no longer sufficient.
            It was decided that a professional approach was necessary and it could no longer be continued as a hobby.
            In 2014, Hasan decided to leave Cobaltstraat and move to Bleiswijkseweg.
            As revenues were still marginal, only anti-squat properties could be rented, which still required frequent relocation.
            In 2015, Hasan took the important step to house his now extensive collection in a professional company.
